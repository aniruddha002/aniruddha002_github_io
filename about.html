				<h2 class="head1">Introduction</h2>
				<p class="para">I was born on the nineteenth of December, 1995.Being the only child of my parents ,I had a fun-filled childhood with my parents
					and grandparents.I owe my life's achievements to them,who made sure I was never in any kind of trouble.Being a person who likes 
					sports very much,I have participated in almost all the sporting activities and competitions held.<br><br>
					
					I try to live by the motto-"Live Life to the fullest" .My friends,who are always beside me have helped me a lot through thick
					and thin.Keeping in touch with all of them is a tough task but I do try it.My life,like the others',has definitely not been a bed 
					of roses.I have been through many highs and lows ,thick and thin.Often I have 
					failed and have lost heart many a times but I try to see failure as a"stepping stone for success".The experiences I have gathered 
					will help me avoid making the same mistakes further.<br><br>
					
					I am seen as a fun-loving personand an avid gamer and watcher of movies and TV Shows .I like to spend time with my parents as much as I
					like to spend time with my friends.
					
					I am currently in my early 20s and would like to do something(or build something) from which the people of Earth benefit.Hopefully I
					will be successful in doing that.
				
				</p>
				
				<h2 class="head1">Academics</h2>
				<p class="para">
					I started my school life at St Xavier's in Durgapur where I spent a better part of my ten years,learning everything from alphabets to
					complicated algebra and from nursery rhymes to Shakespeare .I am grateful to the teachers and friends who taught me the rights and wrongs 
					of life.After my ICSE examinations I studied in Hem Sheela Model School,Durgapur for my higher secondary examinations.These years of school 
					life not only comprised of studying and academics but they consisted of fun-filled days with friends,playing together in the field and many 
					other activities.All these things have helped imbibe a sense of responsibility,teamwork in me and have made up the person I am today.
					
					I could not crack the JEE Advanced exam in the first attempt so,while studying in NIT,Durgapur and studying again for the exams,I cracked it
					in the second attempt<br><br>
					
					Thus,I am now currently in IIT Kharagpur,having completed my first year which was full of enjoyment,little studies(yes,only a little) and a 
					great time with friends,with me looking forward to the years to come.
				</p>
				
				<h2 class="head1">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
				
				<p class="para">
					I have written more often than once that I like watching movies,TV shows and love playing sports and games.Other than those,I also like reading
					novels,fictions and classics.Aside from these,in my pass-time I often do web-designing and app-development for fun.Though I do these for fun,as I
					mentioned,I often like the prospect of developing web-pages and apps for companies .Beside these,I also have a great interest in automobiles and 
					hopefully in the future I can become an automobile engineer,that is,if my plans do not change.
					I like travelling too and having visited many places of India,I would like to visit more places,both in India and abroad.<br><br>
					These are all that interest me,and if I find anything new ,I'll be sure to add them here.
				</p>
				<h2 class="head1">Future Goals</h2>
				<p class="para">
					I aim to become a good web-developer and an android app-developer,and design good and interactive web pages for websites and companies.
					I also aim to become an automobile engineer or do research in the field of automobiles,which will help the common people.Aside from these,I aim
					to do something for the good of all people ,that is,I aim to develop or design something that will help out all the people,both rich and poor,
					for example steps to curb global warming or an alternative,non polluting fuel to help solve the energy crisis.
